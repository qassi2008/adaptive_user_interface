# Adaptive UI for Cognitive Load Management
The Adaptive UI for Cognitive Load Management is a web-based dashboard designed to dynamically adjust its interface based on user cognitive load and physiological metrics.
By leveraging user interaction data, such as error rates and heart rate, the system simplifies or adapts its interface to reduce stress and improve task performance.

This prototype is designed for real-time monitoring, feedback, and adaptability, ensuring a more efficient and user-friendly experience
